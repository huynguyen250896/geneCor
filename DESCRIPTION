Description: Automatically individually compute the Pearson's correlation 
    coefficients of shared genes between CNA data and EXP data, 
    and those between MET data and EXP data, visualize the distribution of expression of     
    CNVcor genes and expression of METcor genes on a page, 
    and examine the significance of each of those skewed distributions.
