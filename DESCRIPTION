Title: geneCor: Identification of correlation between two pairs of three datasets, visualization of Z-score distributions of those two pairs on a page, and examination of the significance of the skewness of those distributions.
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Quang-Huy Nguyen
Maintainer: Quang-Huy Nguyen <huynguyen96.dnu@gmail.com>
Description: It automatically computes correlation coefficients of individual 
    genes that share between the first data and its corresponding third data, 
    and those that share between the second data and its corresponding third data; 
    visualizes the Z-score distributions of between the first and second data versus 
    their corresponding third data on a page; and examines the significance of the 
    skewness for those distributions using D'Agostino test.  For further information 
    on requirements as well as how to implement this tool, please visit my Github repository:
